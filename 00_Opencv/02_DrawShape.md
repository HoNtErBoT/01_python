During this journey of learning OpenCV in Python, I have realised that we have to do some special signatures in all our codes, so I decided to create a custom detection rectangle box to use whenever I need face detection, recognition, or custom object detection. For that, I realise I have to learn how to draw basic shapes in an open CV. While drawing a rectangle and straight line, I assume I can achieve my goal.
