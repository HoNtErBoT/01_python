# Python Face Detection
Face detection in computers/embedded devices is based on a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.
OpenCV was started at Intel in the year 1999 by **Gary Bradsky**. The first release came a little later in the year 2000. OpenCV essentially stands for **Open Source Computer Vision Library**. Although it is written in optimized C/C++, it has interfaces for Python and Java along with C++.

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Now we will be using the face classifier. 

## We need the folowing packages
